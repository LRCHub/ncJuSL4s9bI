Fly in the other rain
The ride through the cloudy sky
And through a light of thousand candles
Come with me
Fly in the other rain
The ride through the cloudy sky
And through a light of thousand candles
Follow me

Experience, the infinity
Stand up, come and fly with me
Experience, the infinity
Stand up, come and follow me
