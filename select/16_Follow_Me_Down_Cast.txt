I'm looking for you
To follow me down
And I hope that you do
I'm praying that you
Follow me down
And I'll be looking for you

Wont you follow me down, down, down, down
Come on follow me down, down, down, down

I'm not being proud but
I'm standing here now
Not sittin' down
I'm not sitting down but
I'm a gonna stand up
And I'm gonna shout loud

Wont you follow me down, down, down, down
Come on follow me down, down, down, down

It's alright, papa's coming home tonight
It's alright, papa's coming home tonight

Wont you follow me down, down, down, down
Come on follow me down, down, down, down

I won't be the first
I won't be the last
Take from our past
You turn the old into new
If you know what to do
Cause its all there for you
Its all for you
