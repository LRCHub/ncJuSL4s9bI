Oh he's been so warm to me
I hate it when he is so warm to me

And i can hardly wait until the summer comes
I can hardly wait, you know, it wont be long
For now I'm going to sing a song to my love

Oh he kissed me on the cheek
I hate the way he treats me
I hate it when he's sweet

And i can hardly wait until the summer comes
I can hardly wait, you know, it wont be long
For now I'm going to sing a song to my love

I wont wait for you
And I will sing this song
And i can see because I'm free
My love will follow me
