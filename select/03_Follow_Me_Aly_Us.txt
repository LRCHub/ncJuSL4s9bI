I'm hoping to see the day
When my people
Can all relate
We must stop fighting
To achieve the peace
That was torn in our country
We shall all be free

Follow me
Why don't you follow me
To a place
Where we can be free
Come with me
Over there
An interracial hate train
And there's love to share
Can you feel it
It's in the air
Know its time for changes
Time for us to care

Follow me
Why don't you follow me
To a place
Where we can be free

Where we'll all be free
